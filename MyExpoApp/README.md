# File Management App

A React Native file management app built with Expo and NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native).

## Why Expo is Better Than Standard React Native

### 🚀 **Easier Setup**

- **Standard React Native**: Requires Android Studio, JDK, Xcode, complex environment setup
- **Expo**: Just `npx create-expo-app` and you're ready to code!

### 📱 **Cross-Platform Development**

- **Standard React Native**: Need separate setups for iOS/Android, different build processes
- **Expo**: One codebase runs on iOS, Android, and Web with `expo start`

### 🔧 **No Native Code Required**

- **Standard React Native**: Often requires native Android/iOS code for advanced features
- **Expo**: Most features work out-of-the-box with JavaScript/TypeScript only

### 🛠️ **Built-in Tools**

- **Standard React Native**: Need to install and configure separate tools
- **Expo**: Includes debugging, testing, and deployment tools built-in

### 📦 **Easy Publishing**

- **Standard React Native**: Complex build processes, separate app store submissions
- **Expo**: `expo publish` updates your app instantly without app store approval

### 🎨 **Styling Made Simple**

- **Standard React Native**: Complex StyleSheet API, no CSS-like syntax
- **Expo + NativeWind**: Use familiar Tailwind CSS classes with `className` props

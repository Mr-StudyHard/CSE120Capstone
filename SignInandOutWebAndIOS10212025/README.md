# File Management App

A React Native file management app built with Expo and NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native).

## Why Expo is Better Than Standard React Native

### 🚀 **Easier Setup**

- **Standard React Native**: Requires Android Studio, JDK, Xcode, complex environment setup
- **Expo**: Just `npx create-expo-app` and you're ready to code!

### 📱 **Cross-Platform Development**

- **Standard React Native**: Need separate setups for iOS/Android, different build processes
- **Expo**: One codebase runs on iOS, Android, and Web with `expo start`

### 🔧 **No Native Code Required**

- **Standard React Native**: Often requires native Android/iOS code for advanced features
- **Expo**: Most features work out-of-the-box with JavaScript/TypeScript only

### 🛠️ **Built-in Tools**

- **Standard React Native**: Need to install and configure separate tools
- **Expo**: Includes debugging, testing, and deployment tools built-in

### 📦 **Easy Publishing**

- **Standard React Native**: Complex build processes, separate app store submissions
- **Expo**: `expo publish` updates your app instantly without app store approval

### 🎨 **Styling Made Simple**

- **Standard React Native**: Complex StyleSheet API, no CSS-like syntax
- **Expo + NativeWind**: Use familiar Tailwind CSS classes with `className` props

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Run on device:**
   - Install Expo Go app on your phone
   - Scan the QR code from the terminal
   - Or press `i` for iOS simulator, `a` for Android emulator

_Built with ❤️ using Expo for maximum developer experience_

## Web build & run

Development web:

```powershell
cd MyExpoApp
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run web
# Open http://localhost:8081 (or the alternate port printed by Expo)
```

Production/export:

```powershell
# If your local Expo CLI supports it:
npx expo export:web .
# Or install the global Expo CLI and run:
npm install -g expo-cli
expo export:web .

# This will produce a `web-build` (or `web`) directory with static assets you can host.
```

If `expo export:web` complains about bundler type, ensure your project supports Webpack or use a CI runner with full Expo web support.

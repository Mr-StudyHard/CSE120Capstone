## Project Description

In the Software Capstone - I2G (Innovate to Grow) program we develop multiple modules that shall combine to address problems and user needs while searching and organizing information to create new knowledge. Previous projects included aggregation of data from multiple apps, merging selected results from multiple searches, and double email list management. The resulting applications are intended to be used internally and possibly launched into a product or startup. Problem(s) Networking at conferences and expos is effective if information is captured, organized and followed up on. This requires aggregating and cleaning information that is collected verbally, with multiple media and channels, and maybe by multiple collaborators. Current contact management apps and services, and customer relationship management systems (CRM) may have lots of features, but they can only be as good as information that is captured and connected digitally. If the moment is not captured before it's gone, or information by multiple people remains disaggregated, it may not be found or actionable. The I2G team participates in events, conferences and trade shows, and also hosts exhibitor booths, and we realized that investing in such an app would make the investment in networking and a booth significantly more valuable. We want to address this unsolved problem with a mobile and web app, that enables us to easily capture and correlate the disparate digital and analog information captured during networking and talking to people.

## Overview

In Phase 1 a Capstone team developed a back-end and web app with the core functionality.
The requirement of this phase of the project is a mobile application, based on the current system, that:
- captures objects (first text notes, then other file types)
- assigns a unique identifier and a URL to every new object
- stores the object with the timestamp and other metadata (when, where, who, what)
- enables the user to search for objects (by when, where, who, what)
- enables the user to select objects and connect them into new objects
These functionalities need to be provided as real time experience on a mobile device.
Features include:
- reading info from badges (typed and QR codes)
- photos of faces
- business cards
- voice notes
- typed notes
- handwritten notes
- messages
Bonus features of this application will include the following:
- leveraging available technology, e.g. OCR, QR, etc.,
- enable multiple users with their own account,
- aggregate information captured by multiple people.

As a result, a user can immediately search by who, what, when, and where, and find or navigate to learn all
information about a contact captured by multiple people and media


### Goals

We aim to help people that attend networking events, organize their information on the fly and have an app to view and share a unique URL for each of their media, such as notes, files, images, etc.
